# 🌧️ Kaggle Rainfall Prediction using XGBoost  

This project is part of the **Kaggle Playground Series** (S5E3) where we predict the probability of rainfall using meteorological data. The dataset contains various weather features such as **temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and sunshine duration**.The dataset provided is madeup data.

## 📌 Project Overview  
- Uses **XGBoost** as the main machine learning model.  
- Performs **feature scaling** using `StandardScaler`.  
- **Hyperparameter tuning** is recommended to improve accuracy.  
- Generates a **Kaggle submission file** with probability predictions.
